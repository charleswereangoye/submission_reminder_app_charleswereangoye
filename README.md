# Submission Reminder App

In this project i am supposed to write a simple shell script that will help remind students about their pending assignment submissions.

---

# What This App Does

- Helps in tracking student assignment submissions.
- Helps in checking which students have not submitted their assignments.
- Helps in checking different varieties of submissions depending on assignment name.

---

# Files You Will Come Across To Use

- create_environment.sh: This script file sets up everything you need to run the app.
- copilot_shell_script.sh: This script file helps you change the assignment name in the app.
- startup.sh: This script file runs the app to show the students who haven't submitted.
- reminder.sh, functions.sh, config.env, and submissions.txt: These are files the app uses to work properly. They are created by create_environment.sh.
